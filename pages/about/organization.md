## Position in GSA/Technology Transformation Services (TTS):

The CoEs are led by Bob DeLuca who reports directly to Joanne Collins Smee, the Deputy Commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS) and Director of TTS.

## Relation to Unified Shared Services Management (USSM):

CoEs have a clear understanding of USSM’s services and ensure they are considered prior to developing a new product.

## Relation to 18F:

When a shared service isn’t available or an off the shelf product isn’t available for acquisition, the CoEs will look for opportunities to leverage 18F product development and management expertise in our engagements.
