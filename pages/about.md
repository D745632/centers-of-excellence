<div class="deck">Accelerate the modernization of IT to improve the customer experience and reduce legacy IT spending across the government.</div>

## Our Values:

* **Customer before anything else** - Understanding and predicting the needs of citizens/customers is our highest priority. Regularly obtaining customer feedback allows an agency to modernize technology in a way that continuously meets the customers needs while creating a positive experience. 

* **Innovate from within** - There is a lot of great technical talent across the government, we strive to identify those innovators and harness their experience in the CoEs.

* **Collaborate for success** - The CoEs recruit the best and brightest from our customerâ€™s workforce to co-lead modernization efforts and ensure success and longevity beyond CoE engagements.

* **Rely on best practices** - We also partner with the private sector to implement the latest technology, leverage best practices, accelerate modernization and avoid common pitfalls.

* **Centralize our resources** - By standing up the Centers of Excellence we strive to be a centralized resource of the brightest talent, best practices, proven processes and acquisition vehicles to yield the best results across government.
