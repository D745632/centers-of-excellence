<div class="deck">Accelerate the modernization of IT across government by leveraging private sector innovation and centralized best practices and expertise.</div>

## Our Values:

* **Innovate from within** - There is a lot of great technical talent across the government, we strive to identify those innovators and harness their experience in the CoEs.

* **Collaborate for success** - The CoEs recruit the best and brightest from our customerâ€™s workforce to co-lead modernization efforts and ensure success and longevity beyond CoE engagements.

* **Technology for the customer** - Modernizing IT across government is our mission but, all modernization efforts must take a customer first approach to requirements development.

## Our Story:

The CoEs were initiated by the Office of American Innovation to address the need for agencies to undergo technical transformation as opposed to piecemeal modernization to deliver on their mission objectives and meet the needs of citizens.
