The success of the IT Modernization Centers of Excellence depends on our ability to identify and harness best practices within and outside of government. To inform our approach and refine our processes, we regularly meet with agencies and industry partners to discuss their successes and challenges. If you are interested in learning more about the Centers of Excellence or discussing tools or solutions, please reach out to us at ConnectCoE@gsa.gov.
