IT Infrastructure Optimization Centers of Excellence (CoE) is supporting the USDA with consolidation of data centers from 39 to 2. Weâ€™ve already met the closure goal by closing 18 data centers in FY 2018, and continue to move full speed ahead by helping agencies develop their migration planning/project plans for data centers scheduled for closure in FY 2019. The CoEs also support mission areas in parallel efforts to optimize their IT infrastructure through performing application rationalization and conducting cloud readiness assessments.
